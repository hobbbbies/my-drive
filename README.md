MyDrive is a personal project I created in Express to teach myself the ins and outs of Express/Node, routers, authorization, and cloud storage with RLS protection.

It functions as a mockup of a storage site, such as Google Drive, and it allows you to operate with both files and folders in a CRUD manner, and provides secure protection of everything that gets uploaded, 
so you don't have to worry about your files getting stolen.

The site can be found [here](https://my-drive-qr71.onrender.com/); it may take up to a minute to load. 

Originally created to use Prisma-ORM and passportjs Auth, this project eventually shifted to using supabase auth and storage, for ease of use, security, and of course cloud storage uses.
